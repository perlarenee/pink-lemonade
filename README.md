## Pink Lemonade for the Tired Mind

Are you tired and frustrated? Do meditation apps keep sending you notifications at inconvenient times and showing you articles that are too long and that aren't quite what you need? Maybe you prefer memes but browsing social media is too distracting. Maybe poetry is your thing, but how to find what you want and when? 

Maybe you need a cold glass of pink lemonade...for your mind. 

Or maybe some steaming hot tea, or a frothy capuchino. 

Download this app to gain access to our unrivaled collection of short stories, memes, quotes and expressions, and poetry. Choose how long, how often and what time you want reminders to sit down and enjoy. 

You are in control. You can get what you need to feel powerful and refreshed. 

Enjoy some Pink Lemonde for a Tired Mind.
